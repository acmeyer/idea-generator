# Idea Generator

This program is for helping you to generate ideas by leveraging GPT (through OpenAI's API). The basics for how it works is that you provide it a prompt about what kinds of ideas you're looking for (examples are also provided below) and GPT will generate a list of ideas for you. You can then use this list however you want (for example, it could spur new ideas for you or you can filter and sort them by your own personal ranking, etc).
